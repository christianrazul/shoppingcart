## Features

- **Product Listing**: Browse a comprehensive list of products with detailed descriptions all from the FakeStoreAPI.
- **Dynamic Cart Management**: Add items to your cart as needed.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless shopping experience on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter products based on various categories to quickly find what you're looking for.

## Core Learnings
During the development of ShoppingCart, I deepened my understanding of advanced ReactJS techniques and other technologies. Below are key areas of significant learning:

### Custom Hooks and Context API
- **Custom Hooks**: I developed custom hooks to manage reusable state logic across components, enhancing code maintainability.
- **Context API**: Utilizing the Context API helped avoid prop drilling. My CartContext provided global access to the shopping cart's state, simplifying its management.

### Routing with React Router Dom
- **Dynamic Routing**: I used react-router-dom for effective multi-page setups within this single-page application. Learning to configure nested routes was crucial.
- **Protected Routes**: I explored protected routes and navigation patterns, essential for managing user access and state-based redirection.

### UI Components with Shadcn and Tailwind CSS
- **Shadcn Components**: I integrated shadcn components for robust and customizable UI elements, speeding up development and ensuring consistency.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS facilitated rapid, responsive design directly within HTML, offering precise control over styling and enhancing the app’s aesthetics.

### Data Fetching
- **API Integration**: I implemented data fetching from FakeStoreAPI to populate the product listings. This experience taught me efficient asynchronous API interactions and state updates in React.

## Reflective Insights
Building this project enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills. Each feature posed unique challenges, fostering a deeper understanding of effective component modularity and state management in web development.
